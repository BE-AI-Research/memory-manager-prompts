Memory Manager Prompts

Overview
A lightweight memory management system designed to handle prompt-based memory operations, including storage, retrieval, and context-aware memory optimization. This tool is ideal for applications requiring efficient memory allocation and tracking of prompt-related data.

Features
- **Context-aware optimization**: Prioritize memory allocation based on prompt importance or frequency.
- **Scalable storage**: Supports both in-memory and persistent storage solutions.

Usage
1. Initialize the memory manager with desired configuration.
2. Use prompt-specific commands to allocate, retrieve, or release memory.
3. Monitor memory usage through built-in analytics tools.
